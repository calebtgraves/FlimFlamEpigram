Players can join the game using a unique code and entering their names. Once they're in, each player receives exclusive prompts on their device and has time to craft their responses. Multiple rounds provide opportunities to answer a variety of unique prompts. Afterward, everyone can enjoy a good laugh by viewing each other's responses to the prompts. The ultimate goal is to have fun and share laughter over the creative answers. Towards the end, participants can cast votes to determine the funniest response among themselves.
